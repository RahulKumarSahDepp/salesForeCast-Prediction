# salesForeCast-Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts future sales using historical data, lag features, and XGBoost regression. The notebook includes data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
# Sales Forecasting with XGBoost

This project builds a machine learning model to predict future sales using historical data and engineered lag features.  
The notebook walks through the complete workflow from data loading to final model evaluation.

## üìå Objectives
- Forecast sales based on past transaction patterns
- Explore how customer segments, product categories, and regions influence sales
- Demonstrate feature engineering for time-series forecasting
- Build and evaluate a regression model using XGBoost

## ‚úÖ Features & Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values
- Dropping unused columns
- Converting date features
- Encoding categorical columns

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- Lag features (e.g., previous day/week/month sales)
- Aggregations by region, product, category
- Train/Test split

### 3. **Modeling**
- XGBoost Regressor
- Hyperparameters: max_depth, n_estimators, learning_rate
- Training on processed data

### 4. **Evaluation**
- R¬≤ Score
- RMSE
- MAE
- Visual comparison of real vs predicted sales
